Week 4 Project Questions

Part 2. Modeling challenge
Letâ€™s say that the Director of Product at greenery comes to us (the head Analytics Engineer) and asks some questions:
How are our users moving through the product funnel?
Which steps in the funnel have largest drop off points?


======================================================================================================================
There are 578 sessions in total.  Within these session, there are:
- 578 sessions with "product view"
- 467 sessions with "add to cart"
- 361 sessions with "checkout"

In terms of absolute counts, the largest dropoff is found between "product view" and "add to cart". (i.e. drop off of 111 sessions/users)
In terms of % proportion, the largest dropoff is found between "add to cart" and "checkout". (i.e. -22.7%)
